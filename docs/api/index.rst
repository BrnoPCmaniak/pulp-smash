API Documentation
=================

This is the Pulp Smash API documentation. It is mostly auto generated from the
source code. It is split into two sections: documentation on tests for Pulp
(:doc:`pulp_smash`) and documentation on unit tests for Pulp Smash itself
(:doc:`tests`).

Beware that Pulp Smash is very new. Its API is **not stable**. This section of
the documentation should be treated as a handy reference for developers, not a
gospel.
